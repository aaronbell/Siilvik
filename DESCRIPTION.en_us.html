<p>Selawik is an OpenSource, metrics-compatible, Segoe UI replacement font available on GitHub. Segoe UI is Microsoftâ€™s core UI and branding typeface.</p>
<p>The major challenge of this project was to design a typeface that matched the metrics, style, and feel of Segoe UI while being sufficiently different.</p>
